# Architecture — Current State

**Last updated:** 2026-09-13 (session 23; §4-§6 carry the most recent
content — this banner previously understated how current the body was).
This is the single current source of
truth for the pipeline design. It supersedes `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`,
`docs/THESIS_NARRATIVE.md`, and `docs/SANITY_CHECK_2026-07-06.md` — those are
kept for history (each now has a banner pointing here) but describe designs
this project has since moved past. If you are a new session picking up this
project, read this file, then the latest `sessions/` entry.

## 1. How we got here (context for why this doc exists)

Between 2026-07-31 and 2026-08-19 the Stage 3 design went through three
undocumented-in-one-place iterations: (1) the original build had phi4-mini
narrate Stage 1's own SHAP values — rejected in session 11 as "essentially
SHAP explanation + LLM, a well-trodden pattern with no novel finding"; (2)
the "Cross-Modal Discordance Analysis" replacement (session 11) had phi4-mini
freely classify a 9-category discordance taxonomy from a raw
`stage2_score - stage1_score` difference; (3) three separate planning
artifacts (an evaluation critique, a Project Brief, and a Working Paper — all
2026-08-16/17) independently converged on fixing this by making phi4-mini an
*independent* auditor with a *quantitatively computed* discordance measure.
A colleague's remediation review (2026-08-19) confirmed the raw-subtraction
approach in (3) was still arithmetically fragile (P1) even with shared
calibration, because two different model families are not guaranteed to have
equal residual miscalibration.

Session 15 (2026-08-25) implemented the resolution: percentile-rank
displacement instead of raw subtraction, and phi4-mini returns its own
uphold/override decision rather than narrating or classifying anyone else's.
See that session log for the full reasoning trail.

## 2. The three layers, as implemented now

### Layer 1 — XGBoost (structured screen)

- Input: ~40 structured MIMIC-IV features (demographics, admission traits,
  prior utilisation, Charlson comorbidity index, lab/vital aggregates).
- Output: calibrated risk score.
- **Operating point policy (changed 2026-08-25): capacity-constrained,
  primary.** Flags the top `stage1.capacity_k` fraction of admissions
  (default 15%) rather than the lowest threshold meeting a recall floor. The
  old recall-floor policy (`recall >= 0.85`) flagged 66.94% of all
  admissions — not a deployable triage. Recall-floor is retained and reported
  as a secondary table for comparability with prior literature
  (`src/model/metrics.py:select_threshold_for_recall`,
  `select_threshold_for_capacity`).
- Config: `stage1.threshold_strategy`, `stage1.capacity_k`,
  `stage1.capacity_report_points` (`config.yaml`).

### Layer 2 — Clinical-Longformer, note-only (independent note-based estimate)

- Plain `LongformerForSequenceClassification` fine-tuned on discharge notes
  only — **no structured features**. Clinical-Longformer backbone, 4096-token
  window (changed from 2048 — session 14 measured 74% of discharge notes
  exceeding 2048 tokens, median ~2,649; the 2048 setting was based on an
  earlier, since-corrected estimate).
- **FusionLongformer (structured features + note, jointly trained) was
  designed, built, and reverted on 2026-08-26 without ever completing a
  training run.** `models/` never contained fusion weights — every evaluated
  Stage 2 number that exists (`stage2_evaluation.json`, dated 2026-08-01) is
  from the plain note-only model. Decision: drop fusion as a modeling target.
  Reasons: (1) note-only is the cleaner independence story for Layer 3's
  discordance measure — Stage 1 (~40 structured features) and Stage 2 (note
  text, zero structured features) are unambiguously informationally
  independent, no caveating required; (2) it was never trained, so dropping
  it costs nothing already built, while training it for the first time would
  cost a full KISSKI/Grete GPU run for a design whose only role was Table 2
  Row 3 of the comparison study (a secondary RQ1 sub-question, not the
  thesis's actual contribution); (3) `src/stage2/train.py` had been fully
  rewritten around fusion with no way left to reproduce the working,
  already-evaluated plain model — reverting `train.py`/`dataset.py`/
  `predict.py`/`_utils.py` to their pre-fusion versions (git commit
  `8a4af36`) fixes that as a side effect. `src/stage2/model.py`
  (`FusionLongformer` class) was deleted; `STRUCT_FEATURE_COLS` no longer
  exists. If joint fusion is wanted later, treat it as new work, not a
  resumption — the code for it is gone.
- Produces `stage2_score`. `stage2_confirmed` (a per-age-band threshold
  decision) is still computed and still useful for the N1 ablation's
  "cascade" arm, but is **not** the final word on a patient — see Layer 3.

### Layer 3 — MedGemma-27B via HF transformers + lm-format-enforcer (independent auditor)

Rewritten 2026-08-25, extended 2026-08-28 (session 18) and 2026-08-28
(session 19) (`src/stage3/explain.py`, `src/stage3/pipeline.py`,
`src/stage3/models.py`). Serving switched from Ollama/phi4-mini to
`google/medgemma-27b-text-it` 2026-09-10 (session 23), first via vLLM, then
to plain HF `transformers.generate()` + `lm-format-enforcer` 2026-09-15
once KISSKI's CUDA 12.8 driver ceiling proved structurally incompatible
with vLLM's flashinfer/CUTLASS kernels regardless of vLLM/torch version —
see `config.yaml`'s `stage3.model_name` comment for the model/license
comparison and `sessions/` for the full serving-mechanism diagnosis.
Inputs: Stage 1's score + SHAP-ranked reasons,
Stage 2's score, the discharge note itself (near-full text, not a 5-sentence
attention summary), and a pre-computed discordance mode.

**Grounds taxonomy (session 19), replacing the single free-choice
`primary_clinical_domain`.** The LLM extracts a list of `mitigating_grounds`
and `aggravating_grounds`, each with its own verbatim quote, from two fixed
lists (`MITIGATING_GROUNDS`, `AGGRAVATING_GROUNDS` in `explain.py`) — fixed
list only; a ground outside the taxonomy, or one with an empty quote, fails
the whole response (don't let the model invent categories). Each quote is
independently checked against the note text (`verify_quote`, per ground);
`all_quotes_verified` is True only if every extracted quote verified.
`planned_return` remains a separate, always-answered field (yes/no/not_stated
per `PLANNED_RETURN_ANSWERS`) — independent of `"planned_return"` also
existing as a mitigating ground the model may cite when it drives the
decision; the two are not merged (also see `TARGET_COL_UNPLANNED` in
`src/schemas.py`/`src/data/features.py`, which computes the same distinction
at the label level, independently of Stage 3).

**Two decisions, not one (session 19).** `decision_model` is the LLM's own
independent uphold / override / insufficient_evidence judgment (not a
narration of Stage 2's — Stage 2's score is evidence the auditor reasons
over, not a decision it explains); this is what drives the final pipeline
prediction (`evaluate_pipeline.py:_apply_stage3_decisions`). `decision_rule`
is the same three-way decision recomputed **deterministically in code**
(`compute_decision_rule`) from the grounds the model itself extracted — not
asked of the model, not a replacement for its free judgment (§5 item 3a:
a small addition to the schema, not a switch to pure extraction), reported
alongside `decision_model` as a consistency metric and a fully transparent
fallback. `insufficient_evidence` (new third value) is a code-side judgment
about the note's length — a note below `_MIN_INFORMATIVE_NOTE_CHARS`
cannot ground either finding regardless of what was extracted from it.

**Schema-constrained generation (session 19; serving mechanism changed
session 23, changed again 2026-09-15, same guarantee preserved each time).**
`call_llm` passes a JSON schema (`_LLMOutput.model_json_schema()`) as a
guided-decoding constraint — originally to Ollama's `format=` parameter,
then to vLLM's `GuidedDecodingParams`, now to `lm-format-enforcer`'s
`prefix_allowed_tokens_fn` hook into plain HF `transformers.generate()`
(the vLLM→lm-format-enforcer switch was forced by KISSKI's CUDA 12.8
driver ceiling being structurally incompatible with vLLM's
flashinfer/CUTLASS kernels — see `sessions/` for the diagnosis; not the
generic `format="json"`) — this is what nearly eliminates malformed-JSON
parse failures. The prompt
was also reordered so the model emits
grounds/evidence *before* `decision` (previously `decision` was asked first)
— an autoregressive model conditions on what it has already written, so
asking for decision first invited the model to invent justification to fit
a decision already reached.

`note_truncated` and `model_name` (session 19) are logged on every row —
required groundwork for the (still-blocked, see §5) model-scale robustness
arm, and for characterising the truncation-asymmetry question in §6.

**Discordance mode is computed quantitatively, never by the LLM**
(`compute_discordance` in `src/stage3/explain.py`):

```
r1 = percentile rank of stage1_score within the flagged+noted cohort
r2 = percentile rank of stage2_score within the same cohort
displacement = r2 - r1                          # range [-100, +100]
NOTE_MITIGATES  if displacement <= -20
NOTE_AMPLIFIES  if displacement >= +20
CONCORDANT      otherwise
```

Percentile rank (not raw `stage2_score - stage1_score`) because Stage 1 and
Stage 2 are different model families and are not guaranteed to share
equivalent calibration error even after isotonic calibration — rank
displacement is invariant to that risk by construction. The `20`
percentile-point threshold (`stage3.discordance_displacement_pp`) is a
provisional value; validate empirically (percentile sweep of the observed
displacement distribution) before reporting it as a result — nobody has done
this yet.

`stage3.temperature` is pinned at `0.0`. Uphold/override is the primary
outcome variable for RQ2; a stochastic auditor makes any reported effect a
sample from a distribution rather than a fixed, checkable quantity.

### RQ1 and RQ2 — which module answers what

- **RQ1 — does text carry signal at all?** Layer 1 vs. Layer 2, scored
  independently on the *same* population (not gated by Layer 1's flag) and
  compared head-to-head. `src/stage2/predict.py:predict_stage2_all` produces
  the population-wide Layer 2 scores this needs;
  `src/model/compare_layers.py` does the comparison. Neither model feeds the
  other here — this is not the cascade.
- **RQ2 — does the auditor add value over Layer 1 alone?** Layer 3 audits
  Layer 1's positive predictions using Layer 2's score as evidence.
  `src/stage3/batch.py:run_batch_audit` runs this at scale;
  `src/model/evaluate_pipeline.py` reports the resulting pipeline metrics
  with Layer 3's decision (not Layer 2's threshold) as the final prediction
  wherever a batch audit covers the admission. The load-bearing comparison
  (colleague review item 1, 2026-08-28) is against a **control arm**:
  Layer 1 alone, its threshold raised to match the full system's alert
  volume exactly (`evaluate_pipeline.py:_control_arm_report`, using
  `select_threshold_for_capacity`) — not an unconstrained Layer 1. Without
  this, an apparent precision gain from the cascade could just be Layer 1
  flagging fewer admissions, which raising its own threshold would do for
  free. Reported as `report["pipeline"]["control_arm_stage1_matched"]`.
  `run_batch_audit` always audits **every** Stage 1-flagged, note-covered
  admission (blanket, unconditional) — this was raised as an open question
  (should Stage 3 only run on discordant cases?) and resolved 2026-08-28
  (session 19, see §5) as: keep the blanket run, and answer the question as
  a **post-hoc analysis** of a completed run instead
  (`evaluate_pipeline.py:_conditional_triggering_report`,
  `report["pipeline"]["conditional_triggering"]`) — this reports the
  LLM-call count and metric delta conditional (discordant-only) triggering
  would have cost/saved, without ever forfeiting the ability to check
  whether the auditor would have agreed on concordant cases anyway.

## 3. What changed in code

All of the below required no model retraining and are already implemented.

**Session 15 (2026-08-25):**

- `config.yaml` / `src/config_schema.py`: `stage2.max_seq_length` 2048→4096;
  `stage3.temperature` 0.3→0.0; new `stage1.threshold_strategy`,
  `stage1.capacity_k`, `stage1.capacity_report_points`; new
  `stage3.discordance_displacement_pp`.
- `src/model/metrics.py`: added `select_threshold_for_capacity`,
  `metrics_at_capacity_points` (precision@K, lift@K).
- `src/model/train.py`, `src/model/evaluate.py`: Stage 1 now selects and
  reports both operating points; capacity-constrained is primary.
- `src/model/evaluate_pipeline.py`: added the C9 fallback — flagged-but-
  no-note patients now fall back to Stage 1's own flag instead of being
  silently scored negative. Reports `pipeline.full_cohort` (primary, 100% of
  test admissions) and `pipeline.notes_cohort` (secondary, matches how
  "+21% precision" was computed before this fix) separately; never report
  `notes_cohort` alone.
- `src/stage3/explain.py`: full rewrite (see §2 above).
- `src/stage3/models.py`, `src/stage3/pipeline.py`: updated to the new
  `ExplanationResult` schema (`decision`, `r1`, `r2`, `displacement`,
  `primary_clinical_domain`, `clinical_justification` replace the old
  `discordance_mode`-as-LLM-opinion / `primary_category` / `narrative`).
- `data/processed/features.csv` rebuilt with the session-14 fixes (fixed
  `admission_type_emergency` mapping, 3 new features, 521,191 rows).
- `tests/`: `test_stage3_explain.py` rewritten for the new API (incl. a test
  that percentile-rank displacement is invariant to monotonic rescaling —
  the property raw subtraction lacks); `test_metrics.py` and
  `test_config.py` extended/updated.

**Session 16 (2026-08-26):**

- **FusionLongformer dropped.** `src/stage2/{train,dataset,predict,_utils}.py`
  reverted to their pre-fusion versions (git commit `8a4af36`); `model.py`
  (the `FusionLongformer` class) deleted. Stage 2 is a plain, note-only
  Clinical-Longformer — see §2. `setup_stage2.py` also had unrelated
  pre-existing pylint issues (dead imports, missing docstrings) fixed while
  touching this code.
- **Isotonic calibration added for Stage 1** (`src/model/calibration.py`).
  Fit on OOF predictions (the same ones used for threshold selection — no
  new leakage surface), stored in the artifact, applied everywhere a
  Stage 1 score is produced (`evaluate.py`, `evaluate_pipeline.py`,
  `stage2/predict.py`, `api.py`). Saves `models/stage1_calibration.json`
  (Brier before/after + reliability-curve breakpoints). Monotonic, so it
  does not change which admissions get flagged, only what the reported
  probability means.
- **Bootstrap CIs added** (`src/model/bootstrap.py`): generic
  `bootstrap_ci(y_true, y_score, metric_fn, groups=...)` with patient-level
  (`subject_id`) cluster resampling. Wired into `evaluate.py` for
  AUROC/AUPRC/precision/recall at the primary operating point. **Not yet
  wired into `evaluate_pipeline.py`** — the full/notes-cohort pipeline
  numbers still lack CIs.
- **`readmission_30d_unplanned` label variant added** (P7b). New column in
  the feature matrix: the all-cause label minus outcome admissions whose own
  `admission_type` indicates a planned return (`ELECTIVE`,
  `SURGICAL SAME DAY ADMISSION`) — a structured-data proxy, not a
  note-derived one (`src/data/features.py:compute_readmission_label`). Not
  yet wired into any training/evaluation script — `split_xy` still returns
  the all-cause label by default; using the unplanned variant is a future
  analysis, not automatic.
- **Deleted `models/stage3_discordance_analysis.json`** (git-tracked,
  produced by the pre-session-15 Stage 3 design; schema no longer matches
  the current code, and it demonstrated the exact P2 bug — `NOTE_AMPLIFIES`
  count exceeding `n_confirmed`). Recoverable from git history if needed.

**Session 17 (2026-08-27):** built everything from the session-16 gap audit
that needed no GPU and no open decision.

- **Population-wide Layer 2 scoring** — `src/stage2/predict.py`. New
  `predict_stage2_all` (shares a refactored `_score_core`/`_prepare_population`
  pipeline with the existing `predict_stage2`), scores every test-partition
  admission with a note, not just Layer 1's positives. Output
  `models/stage2_results_all.csv`. `--all` / `--limit` CLI flags added.
  Required for RQ1 — see §2.5.
  **Bug found while smoke-testing, not fully fixed:** running this module's
  CLI standalone (`python -m src.stage2.predict`, with or without `--all`)
  segfaults (SIGSEGV) on macOS ARM — confirmed pre-existing on the
  pre-session-17 code too, not introduced today. Root cause: the same
  MPS/XGBoost C-extension conflict documented elsewhere in this codebase
  (`api.py`, `setup_stage2.py`) — `joblib.load()`-ing the XGBoost artifact
  after torch has initialised crashes on Apple Silicon, and
  `src.stage2.dataset` transitively imports torch, so this module's own
  import order can't prevent it alone. Added the standard `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK`
  mitigation (doesn't fully fix it) and documented the real cause inline.
  **Verified working**: calling `predict_stage2_all(cfg, artifact=<preloaded>)`
  with the artifact loaded before torch imports (`setup_stage2.py`'s own
  pattern) succeeds — confirmed by an ad hoc script, 15-admission smoke test.
  A real fix (lazy-importing everything torch-touching) is a bigger change
  than this session's scope; not attempted to avoid risking
  `setup_stage2.py`'s already-working path. Until fixed: never invoke
  `python -m src.stage2.predict` directly on macOS; drive it the way
  `setup_stage2.py` does, or run on Linux/the cluster.
- **`api.py` stopped gating on Layer 2's threshold.** `list_patients`'s
  `confirmed_only` default flipped `True`→`False`; docstrings updated. Layer
  2's score is evidence for Layer 3, not a display gate, per §2.
  **Follow-up found, not fixed:** the frontend (`frontend/src/api.ts`) has
  its own independent `confirmedOnly = true` default and UI copy built
  around "confirmed" patients (`PatientTable.tsx`, `PipelineDiagram.tsx`) —
  changing the backend default didn't change frontend behaviour. Needs an
  actual frontend change plus a browser check, not a blind edit; not done
  this session.
- **N1 comparison runner (RQ1)** — new `src/model/compare_layers.py`.
  Inner-joins Stage 1's test-partition scores with
  `stage2_results_all.csv` on `hadm_id`, reports both models' AUROC/AUPRC
  (bootstrap 95% CI, patient-level) and an operating point matched to Layer
  1's alert volume, plus a paired bootstrap CI on the AUROC difference.
  Output `models/comparison_rq1.json`.
- **Batch Stage 3 runner (RQ2)** — new `src/stage3/batch.py`. Runs
  `explain_patient` over every admission in `stage2_results.csv`
  (preloading artifact/results/feature matrix once), writes incrementally
  and crash-safe to `models/stage3_batch_results.csv`, supports `--limit`
  and `--resume`. One bad admission no longer kills the run.
- **Discordance-threshold sensitivity sweep** — `sweep_discordance_thresholds`
  in `src/stage3/explain.py` (pure function, reclassifies existing
  `displacement` values at multiple pp thresholds — no rank recomputation
  needed) plus `run_sensitivity_sweep` / `--sweep` in `src/stage3/batch.py`,
  consuming `stage3_batch_results.csv`. Output
  `models/discordance_sensitivity.json`.
- **Layer 3's model call generalised** — `call_phi4mini` → `call_llm(prompt,
  cfg, model_name=None)` in `src/stage3/explain.py`; `explain_patient` gained
  a matching `model_name` passthrough. New `stage3.robustness_model` config
  field (default `null` — a real open decision, not a default to assume; see
  §5). Makes the scale-robustness arm wireable without further code changes
  once a model is chosen.
- **`evaluate_pipeline.py`'s final prediction now prefers Layer 3's
  decision.** New `_apply_stage3_decisions`: wherever
  `stage3_batch_results.csv` has a decision for an admission, it replaces
  `stage2_confirmed` (+ C9 fallback) as the final prediction; admissions
  Layer 3 hasn't covered keep the prior C9-corrected value unchanged — this
  only ever narrows the gap to the design, never drops coverage. Report now
  includes a `stage3` block reporting coverage.
- Tests: `test_compare_layers.py`, `test_stage3_batch.py`,
  `test_evaluate_pipeline.py` (new); `test_stage3_explain.py` extended for
  the sweep. 108 passed, 1 skipped; pylint 10.00/10.

**Session 18 (2026-08-28):** built the BUILD-NOW items from a colleague
review (control arm, evidence quoting, planned-return question) plus the
narrative-doc rewrite; the colleague's other two items (retrain Stage 1,
per-group context) and the user's own four open architecture questions were
deliberately left as open decisions, not implemented — see §5.

- **Control arm** — `evaluate_pipeline.py:_control_arm_report` (§2.5 above).
  Stage 1 alone, threshold raised to match the full system's realized alert
  rate, evaluated with the same `_pipeline_report` shape as the cascade.
  This is now the load-bearing comparison for "does the cascade+audit add
  value" — see §2.5.
- **Evidence quoting** — `src/stage3/explain.py`/`models.py`/`pipeline.py`.
  New `supporting_quote` + `quote_verified` fields (§2 above), enforced at
  the same level as `decision` in `_parse_response`. `verify_quote()` is a
  plain substring check (`supporting_quote.strip() in note_text`) — cheap by
  design, not a semantic entailment check; it catches fabricated quotes, not
  misleading-but-verbatim ones.
- **Planned-return question** — new `planned_return` field on the same
  three files, taxonomy `PLANNED_RETURN_ANSWERS = ("yes", "no",
  "not_stated")` (§2, §6 above).
- **Narrative docs rewritten** — `docs/THESIS_NARRATIVE.md`'s one-sentence
  summary, abstract, storyline options, and "if the professor asks" section,
  plus the paste-ready session-start prompt and N5 literature-positioning
  prompt in `docs/SANITY_CHECK_2026-07-06.md`, no longer describe a
  "high-recall screen" that a Stage 2 "second reader" "vetoes" — they now
  describe the capacity-constrained screen / independent second opinion /
  independent auditor design this file has described since session 15.
  Abstract numbers replaced with a retrain-pending placeholder rather than
  the stale recall-floor figures (AUROC 0.706, recall 0.85) they previously
  carried.
- Tests: `test_evaluate_pipeline.py`, `test_stage3_explain.py`,
  `test_stage3_batch.py` extended for the new fields. 121 passed, 1 skipped;
  pylint 10.00/10.

**Session 19 (2026-08-28):** evaluated a colleague's independent pipeline
restructuring proposal against the current implementation (most of it
matched what session 18 had already built, or restated §5's already-decided
items); built the BUILD-NOW items from that evaluation, plus two decisions
made this session (keep blanket Stage 3 triggering + analyse conditional
triggering post-hoc; keep K=0.15 primary) — see §5.

- **Grounds taxonomy replacing `primary_clinical_domain`** —
  `src/stage3/explain.py`: `MITIGATING_GROUNDS` (4) / `AGGRAVATING_GROUNDS`
  (6), each extracted ground with its own quote, independently verified.
  Fixed list only — an invalid ground or empty quote fails the whole
  response, same enforcement level as before.
- **`decision_model` + `decision_rule`** — the LLM's own decision, reported
  alongside a deterministic recomputation from the extracted grounds
  (`compute_decision_rule`). Adds `insufficient_evidence` as a third
  decision value (code-side, based on note length). `evaluate_pipeline.py:
  _apply_stage3_decisions` updated to read `decision_model` and treat
  `insufficient_evidence` as no-coverage, not a silent uphold.
- **Schema-constrained Ollama generation** — `call_llm` now passes a JSON
  schema (`format=_LLMOutput.model_json_schema()`), not `format="json"`.
- **Prompt reordered** — grounds/evidence requested before `decision`,
  fixing a real autoregressive-conditioning issue in the prior prompt
  (decision was asked first, evidence after).
- **`note_truncated` / `model_name` logged per row** — groundwork for the
  still-blocked model-scale robustness arm.
- **Conditional-triggering post-hoc analysis** —
  `evaluate_pipeline.py:_conditional_triggering_report` (§2, §5 above).
  Does not change `run_batch_audit`'s targeting.
- **Two validation controls (Phase D1/D2)** — `src/stage3/batch.py:
  run_blind_note_control`, `run_no_stage2_control`; `explain_patient` gained
  `suppress_note`/`suppress_stage2` params, `build_prompt` gained
  `hide_stage2`. Diagnostic functions, not wired into the default batch path.
- **Self-agreement check (Phase D3)** — `src/stage3/batch.py:
  check_self_agreement`, calls `explain_patient` twice per admission and
  reports exact-match agreement on `decision_model`/`decision_rule`/grounds.
- **Selection-bias table gap identified, not yet built** — no
  included-vs-excluded (notes-covered vs. not) baseline-characteristics
  table exists anywhere in the repo; flagged as a genuine gap during the
  colleague-proposal evaluation, not yet implemented — add to §4.
- `frontend/src/types.ts`, `PatientModal.tsx` updated to match the new
  schema (grounds lists, two decisions, `all_quotes_verified`).
- Tests: `test_stage3_explain.py`, `test_stage3_batch.py`,
  `test_evaluate_pipeline.py` extended/rewritten for the new schema and new
  functions. 143 passed, 1 skipped; pylint 10.00/10; frontend `tsc --noEmit`
  clean.

## 4. What is explicitly deferred (not done yet)

Everything in this section needs either GPU/compute time or an explicit
decision — the code to run once either is resolved already exists as of
session 17.

- ~~Retrain Stage 1~~ **Done (2026-09-05, session 22/23)** — 400-trial
  Optuna search, unplanned-readmission target, AUROC 0.7215. See
  `MODEL_CARD.md`.
- ~~Retrain Stage 2~~ **Done (2026-09-09/10, session 23)** — 4096 tokens,
  corrected age-group oversampling, unplanned target. See `MODEL_CARD.md`.
- ~~Run `predict_stage2_all` at full scale~~ **Done (session 23)** — real
  population-wide scores exist in `models/stage2_results_all.csv`.
- ~~Run `compare_layers.py`~~ **Done (session 23)** — first real RQ1
  numbers: Stage 1 AUROC 0.7093 vs. Stage 2 AUROC 0.7101, a null result
  (see `MODEL_CARD.md`). The headline-denominator decision below (notes-
  covered subset as headline) still needs explicit confirmation before this
  is written up as "the" RQ1 answer in the thesis text, but the numbers
  themselves are real and current.
- **Run `batch.py` at full scale** — the actual next step as of session 23.
  Cluster infrastructure (`download_stage3_model.sh`,
  `scripts/slurm_stage3_batch.sh`) and the MedGemma serving switch (now via
  HF transformers + lm-format-enforcer, see above) are in place; a
  10-patient smoke test was queued but not yet confirmed working
  end-to-end. Needed to produce real RQ2 numbers and let
  `evaluate_pipeline.py`'s `stage3` coverage block become non-empty — the
  current pipeline numbers (cascade ≈ control arm) are not yet the real
  RQ2 answer, since Stage 3 hasn't run.
- **Run `batch.py --sweep`** once the above exists, to actually validate
  `discordance_displacement_pp` rather than leave it at the provisional 20.
- **Wire and run the Layer 3 robustness arm** — blocked on the model-choice
  decision below, not on code.
- **N1 ablation runner** (5+ arms) beyond the two-arm RQ1 comparison
  `compare_layers.py` already covers — not yet written. The single most
  load-bearing arm, L1-at-matched-capacity, no longer needs a separate
  runner: `evaluate_pipeline.py:_control_arm_report` (session 18,
  2026-08-28) computes it inline as part of every pipeline evaluation.
- **Bootstrap CIs not yet in `evaluate_pipeline.py`** — `evaluate.py` and
  `compare_layers.py` have them; the cascade's full/notes-cohort pipeline
  numbers still don't.
- Feature audit (vitals missingness, lab itemid validation against
  `d_labitems`) — not touched.
- **Included-vs-excluded (notes-covered vs. not) selection-bias table** —
  no such baseline-characteristics comparison exists anywhere in the repo
  (identified 2026-08-28, session 19). Needed to disclose whether the ~63%
  notes-covered cohort RQ1/RQ2 are evaluated on differs systematically from
  the ~37% without notes.

## 5. Decisions still needed (blocking, not just deferred)

**Resolved 2026-08-28 (session 19):**

- **Conditional Stage 3 triggering.** Kept blanket (audit every flagged,
  note-covered admission) as the execution mode — `run_batch_audit`'s
  targeting logic is unchanged. Discordant-only triggering is answered
  instead as a post-hoc analysis of a completed blanket run
  (`_conditional_triggering_report`, §2 above): committing to conditional
  triggering as the design would mean never learning what auditing
  concordant cases found, and no full batch run has happened yet even
  once, so there was no cost being saved by skipping it now. The
  cost/benefit trade-off is reported as a measured result, not assumed.
- **Operating point K.** Stays at `capacity_k = 0.15` (primary); 20%/10%/5%
  remain secondary `capacity_report_points`, unchanged. A colleague's
  proposal to make K=20% primary had no comparable justification to the
  clinical-capacity argument behind the existing 0.15 choice (session 15) —
  not changed without new operational evidence.

- **Which model runs Layer 3's robustness arm, and is a cloud API even
  permitted on this data?** MIMIC-IV/MIMIC-IV-Note are governed by a
  PhysioNet Data Use Agreement; sending credentialed data to a third-party
  cloud API is very likely restricted without a specific agreement.
  Recommendation: default to a larger *local* model (served the same way
  as the primary auditor — HF transformers + lm-format-enforcer as of
  2026-09-15, see `stage3.model_name`), not a cloud API, unless the DUA is
  explicitly checked and permits it.
  `stage3.robustness_model` is deliberately left `null` pending this — do
  not set it without checking.
- **RQ1's headline comparison denominator.** Layer 2 only ever covers
  admissions with a note (~63% in past runs); Layer 1 covers 100%.
  Recommendation (per the remediation review's denominator-integrity point):
  the headline RQ1 number is both models restricted to the notes-covered
  subset (`stage1_notes_cohort` vs. `stage2_notes_cohort` in
  `comparison_rq1.json`) — the only population both models can be fairly
  compared on — with `stage1_full_population` reported as separate
  deployment context, not blended into the headline claim. Needs explicit
  confirmation before any number from `compare_layers.py` goes in the thesis
  text as "the" RQ1 result.
- **Three more open architecture questions raised 2026-08-28, all
  explicitly left for the user to evaluate, not implemented:** whether
  Stage 1 and Stage 2 should be forced onto identical data splits for
  cleaner comparability (currently: same test partition, but Stage 2 is
  further restricted to the notes-covered subset within it); what exactly
  Stage 3 should be understood to reason "over" beyond the current
  score+SHAP+note+discordance-mode bundle (e.g. should it also see Stage 1's
  raw feature values, not just SHAP strings); and whether per-subgroup
  (e.g. age-band) context should be surfaced to Stage 3 explicitly rather
  than left implicit in the note text and scores.

## 6. Open methodological notes carried forward

- Stage 1's decision threshold is still selected on the same OOF/validation
  data used for early-stopping — a mild contamination risk flagged once in
  an earlier review and never revisited. Still open.
- `readmission_30d_unplanned` (label-level, `src/data/features.py`, now the
  model's actual target via `MODEL_TARGET_COL` — see below) only catches
  planned returns visible in `admission_type` (elective / same-day
  surgical) — a structured-data proxy, not CMS's full ICD-procedure/
  diagnosis-code-based Planned Readmission Algorithm. Planned returns not
  reflected in `admission_type` (e.g. informally scheduled follow-up
  admissions) are not caught. This is not an ad hoc simplification, though
  — it matches the operationalization used by at least one peer-reviewed
  MIMIC-IV benchmark pipeline (Extensive Data Processing Pipeline for
  MIMIC-IV, arXiv:2204.13841) and informal MIMIC community convention
  (MIT-LCP/mimic-code discussion #1215), and Rajkomar et al. 2018 (the most
  rigorous "unplanned" precedent in this project's own citation list, see
  MODELING_PLAN.md) explicitly states there is no single standard
  definition in the field. Separately, and NOT addressed by this proxy
  either way: this project's cohort does not exclude OBSERVATION-type
  stays from the readmission count at all, whereas CMS's measure excludes
  them from the denominator entirely (they aren't billed inpatient
  admissions) — a scope question distinct from the planned/unplanned
  distinction, disclosed here rather than fixed, since resolving it would
  mean re-deriving the cohort definition, not just the label (confirmed
  2026-09-04, alongside the switch of the model's actual target from
  all-cause to this column). Stage 3's `planned_return` field (added
  2026-08-28, §2 above) now gives an LLM-extracted, note-based answer to
  the same question at audit time — but the two are not yet cross-checked
  against each other; whether they agree, and what to do when they don't,
  is unexamined.
- `MODEL_TARGET_COL` (`src/schemas.py`) is the single switch controlling
  which label column (`TARGET_COL`/all-cause vs `TARGET_COL_UNPLANNED`)
  every training/eval script actually uses — set to unplanned as of
  2026-09-04. Before that, every Stage 1 model this project ever produced
  (including the original artifact and several retraining attempts)
  silently trained on all-cause despite every scope-level doc
  (`MODELING_PLAN.md`, `THESIS_NARRATIVE.md`, `MODEL_CARD.md`) stating the
  study targets unplanned readmission — caught during a pre-flight audit,
  not before. If retraining ever needs to compare against the all-cause
  label again, change only this one constant; every consumer (Stage 1's
  `split_xy()`, every Stage 2 module) follows it automatically.
- Truncation asymmetry between Stage 2 (4096 tokens) and Stage 3 (now a
  20,000-character safety cap, effectively near-full note) is much smaller
  than before session 15 but not eliminated for pathologically long notes.
- `training-changes` is still unmerged into `main` (44+ commits ahead as of
  session 15). Nothing in this doc addresses that — it's a repo-hygiene
  decision (merge vs. formally adopt as the working branch), not a code fix.
- Frontend (`frontend/src/`) still assumes the old "Stage 2 gates the
  patient list" model independently of the backend (see session 17 note in
  §3) — needs its own pass with an actual browser check, not covered here.
